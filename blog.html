                    <h2>How to start with DSA</h2>
                    <p>DSA is a fundamental skill that every programmer needs to learn. In my opinion, it is one of the
                        most interesting parts
                        of programming. You can start by following the link I am providing and practicing problems on
                        LeetCode. Additionally,
                        participate in weekly contests on various platforms like LeetCode, Coding Ninjas, CodeForces,
                        CodeChef, AtCoder, etc.
                        <br>
                        You can follow this link to learn DSA from beginning.

                        Computer Networks, Computer Organization and Architecture are also important to know if one want
                        to excel in programming world.
